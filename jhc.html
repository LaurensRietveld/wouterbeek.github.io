  <h2>A Theory of Justice for Health Care</h2>
  <p>Three Questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is health care (morally) special?</li>
    <li>When are health inequalities unjust?</li>
    <li>How can we meet competing health care needs fairly under reasonable resource constraint?</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>No consensus on distribution</h2>
  <p>Fair process?</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Opportunity for Equality:</h1>
  <p>Health care is morally special</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Central role is to maintain normal functioning</li>
    <li>Protection of equality of opportunity</li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Determinants of Health</h2>
  <p>Factors</p>    
  <ul>
    <li>Wealth</li>
    <li>Race and Class</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Social policies are responsible for social and economic inequalities that produce health effects -> justice as fairness of <u>distribution</u> of medical goods.</p>
  <p>In absence of consensus on distribute principles, we need a fair process to establish legitimacy for critical resource allocation decisions. Daniel's proposition: "accountability for reasonability"</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Question 1: what is the special moral importance of health care?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Normal Functioning -> normal range of opportunity as citizens (relative)</li>
    <li>Plans of life (in a perfect world)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Relationship between protection of opportunity and health care implies regulations appropriate to this principle. </p>  
  <p>Social contractors must be assured <i>fair equality of opportunity</i> in
access to jobs and offices.</p>
  <!-- Implications: prohibits discrimination to job and education access but also requires positive measures to correct negative effects on opportunity, including under-development of skills and talents that derive from unfair social practices. Public education, early childhood intervention. -->
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Opportunity over happiness</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>More objective measure</li>
    <li>Implies index primary social goods: rights, liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth, social bases of self-respect. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Protection of normal functioning within the scope of primary good of
opportunity.</p>  
  <p>Implies restoring, not enhancing.</p>
  <!-- People with long-standing 
disability rate their happiness higher than people without the disability. Doesn't
matter: objective standard accessible to all.  -->
</section>


<section>
  <h2> Other primary needs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Paternalistic to place emphasis on health care</li>
    <li>Rebuttal: 'Our' social obligations (as social contractors) is to provide <u>institutions</u> that protect opportunity, not to maximize aggregate welfare.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Universal access to appropriate care, preventive and traditional.</p>
  <p>Limited resources --> hierarchy in needs.</p>
  <!--reasonable constraints, age relative opportunity range to avoid elderly from being disadvantaged: we all age. Some discussion over when someone has 'brute luck' and should be helped, details.-->
</section>


<section>
  <h2> Social factors</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Requires focus on more than traditional health care: prevention "Ambulance waiting at te bottom of the cliff"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Daniel's conjecture: equal liberties + robustly equal opportunity + fair distribution of resources + support for our self-esteem --> eliminate to important degree injustices in health outcomes. </p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2> Basis for conjecture</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Life expectancy in richer countries </li>
    <li>Life expectancy between equally poor countries </li>
    <li>Relative deprivation (both income and general)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Individual level: socioeconomic gradient: with each step higher up on the 
economic ladder we see improved health outcomes. The slope, however, is fixed by the
level of income: the more unequal in economic terms, the more unequal in health terms.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2> But how to allocate resources?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Earlier principles make it easier to address inequality in outcomes,
but doesn't solve disagreement on how to distribute resources.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Daniel's conjecture: equal liberties + robustly equal opportunity + fair distribution
of resources + support for our self-esteem --> eliminate to important degree injustices in
health outcomes.</p>
  </ul>
