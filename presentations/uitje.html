  <h2>What is Ethics?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Meta-ethics: Meaning and reference of moral propositions</li>
    <li>Theoretical ethics: Rational grounding of moral propositions</li>
    <li>Practical ethics: Determine normative rules</li>
    <li>Applied ethics: Societal norms</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Prototypical moral argument</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>"You ought not to extort someone."</li>
    <li>"Why not?"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Because...
  <ul>
    <li>... extortion will hurt the person</li>
    <li>... the person has feelings</li>
    <li>... property rights have been agreed about in our society<li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Meta-ethics</h1>
  <p>Is/ought-problem</p>
  <!-- In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary ways of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when all of a sudden I am surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. -->

<section>
  <h1>What is good?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Good is what the authorities who wield power over me say</li>
    <li>Good is that which has the highest utility</li>
    <li>Good is what what God wants</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Meta-ethics</h1>
  <h2>Naturalistic fallacy</h2>
  If $X$ is good then the question whether $X$ is good is meaningless.
</section>


<section>
  <section>
    <h2>Theoretical ethics: Categorical imperative</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Act only according to a rule of which you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law without contradiction.
    </blockquote>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Absolute and unconditional requirements that must be obeyed in all circumstances.</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Let's apply this...</h2>
  <blockquote>
    Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law without contradiction.
  </blockquote>
  <p class="fragment">Deception</p>
  <p class="fragment">Extortion</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Practical Ethics: To whom do these laws apply?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Example: Killing an animal is wrong if an animal has (sufficient) sentience and/or sapience.</p>
  <div class="fragment">
    <hr/>
    <p>Conditions for moral status:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Sentience</b>: The capacity for phenomenal experience or qualia.</li>
      <li><b>Sapience</b>: A set of capabilities associated with higher intelligence (e.g., self-awareness, being a reason-responsive agent).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>


<section>
  <section>
    <h2>Principles regarding moral status attribution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Substrate Non-Discrimination</b></li>
      <li><b>Ontogeny Non-Discrimination</b></li>
      <li><b>Subjective Rate-of-Time</b></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Principle of Substrate Non-Discrimination</h2>
    <blockquote>
      If two beings have the same functionality and the same conscious experience, and differ only in the substrate of their implementation, then they have the same moral status.
    </blockquote>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Principle of Ontogeny Non-Discrimination</h2>
    <blockquote>
      If two beings have the same functionality and the same consciousness experience, and differ only in how they came into existence, then they have the same moral status.
    </blockquote>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Principle of Subjective Rate-of-Time</h2>
    <p><b>Uploading</b>: A hypothetical future technology enables a human to be transferred from her original implementation in an organic brain onto a digital computer.</p>
    <p class="fragment">Suppose an upload could be sentient, then its subjective rate of time would be different from humans.</p>
    <blockquote class="fragment">
      In cases where the duration of an experience is of basic normative significance, it is experience's subjective duration that counts.
    </blockquote>
  </section>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Societal norms</h2>
  <p>Not founded in ethics.</p>
  <p>Implicitly conditioned on empirical contingencies.</p>
  <div class="fragment">
    <hr/>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Moral agents have reproductive freedom.</li>
      <li>Society must step in to provide the basic needs of children in cases where their parents are unable or refusing to do so.</li>
      <li>An AI may reproduce itself with exponential speed.</li>
    </ul>

    [To] constitute a significant expansion of the field of AI itself, which up to now has focused largely on techniques that are neutral with respect to purpose.

<!--
The progress in AI research makes it timely to focus research not only on making AI more capable, but also on maximizing the societal benefit of AI. Such considerations motivated the AAAI 2008-09 Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures and other projects on AI impacts, and constitute a significant expansion of the field of AI itself, which up to now has focused largely on techniques that are neutral with respect to purpose. We recommend expanded research aimed at ensuring that increasingly capable AI systems are robust and beneficial: our AI systems must do what we want them to do. The attached research priorities document gives many examples of such research directions that can help maximize the societal benefit of AI. This research is by necessity interdisciplinary, because it involves both society and AI. It ranges from economics, law and philosophy to computer security, formal methods and, of course, various branches of AI itself.

  <h1>Part III: Superintelligence</h1>

  <h2>Superintelligence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Weak superintelligence</b>: [Quantitative] Increased processing speed.</li>
    <li><b>Strong superintelligence</b> [Quantitative]
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Analogies for superintelligence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Differences between humans</li>
    <li>Differences between past and present civilizations</li>
    <li>Differences between humans and other animals</li>
  </ul>

  Imagine running a dog mind at very high speed. Would a thousand years of doggy living add up to any human insight?

  <h2>Good-story bias</h2>
  <p>Intuitions about which future scenarios are plausible and realistic may be shaped by what is seen in media, overestimating the probability of scenarios that make for a good story.</p>
