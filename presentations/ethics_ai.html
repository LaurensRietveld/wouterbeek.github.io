  <h1>Part I: The moral status of AI</h1>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>What is Ethics?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Theoretical Ethics</li>
    <li>Practical Ethics</li>
    <li>Societal Norms</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <section>
    <h2>Theoretical Ethics: Categorical Imperative</h2>
    <p class="fragment">
      Act only according to a rule of which you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law without contradiction.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Absolute and unconditional requirements that must be obeyed in all circumstances.</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Let's apply this...</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Deception</p>
  <p class="fragment">Theft</p>
  <blockquote>
    Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law without contradiction.
  </blockquote>
</section>
<!--
<section>
  <h2>Theoretical Ethics</h2>
  <p>Defines <i>moral status</i> in terms of universalizable principles.</p>
  <p>X has moral status if X counts morally in its own right / must be treated not only as a means but also as an end.</p>
</section>
-->
<section>
  <h2>Practical Ethics: To whom do these laws apply?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Example: Abortion is wrong if an embryo has (sufficient) sentience and/or sapience.</p>
  <div class="fragment">
    <hr/>
    <p>Conditions for moral status:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Sentience</b>: The capacity for phenomenal experience or qualia.</li>
      <li><b>Sapience</b>: A set of capabilities associated with higher intelligence (e.g., self-awareness, being a reason-responsive agent).</li>
    </ul>
    <!--<p>Note: AIs may be sapient without being sentient.</p>-->
  </div>
</section>
<section>
  <section>
    <h2>Principles regarding moral status attribution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Substrate Non-Discrimination</b></li>
      <li><b>Ontogeny Non-Discrimination</b></li>
      <li><b>Subjective Rate-of-Time</b></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Principle of Substrate Non-Discrimination</h2>
    <blockquote>
      If two beings have the same functionality and the same conscious experience, and differ only in the substrate of their implementation, then they have the same moral status.
    </blockquote>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Principle of Ontogeny Non-Discrimination</h2>
    <blockquote>
      If two beings have the same functionality and the same consciousness experience, and differ only in how they came into existence, then they have the same moral status.
    </blockquote>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Principle of Subjective Rate-of-Time</h2>
    <p><b>Uploading</b>: A hypothetical future technology enables a human to be transferred from her original implementation in an organic brain onto a digital computer.</p>
    <p class="fragment">Suppose an upload could be sentient, then its subjective rate of time would be different from humans.</p>
    <blockquote class="fragment">
      In cases where the duration of an experience is of basic normative significance, it is experience's subjective duration that counts.
    </blockquote>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Societal norms</h2>
  <p>Not founded in ethics.</p>
  <p>Implicitly conditioned on empirical contingencies.</p>
  <div class="fragment">
    <hr/>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Moral agents have reproductive freedom.</li>
      <li>Society must step in to provide the basic needs of children in cases where their parents are unable or refusing to do so.</li>
      <li>An AI may reproduce itself with exponential speed.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>


<section>
  <h1>Part II: Ethical requirements for AI</h1>
</section>
<!--
<section>
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <blockquote style="font-size: 0.85em;">
    A bank uses a machine learning algorithm to recommend mortgage applications for approval. A rejected applicant brings a lawsuit against the bank, alleging that the algorithm is discriminating racially against mortgage applicants. The bank replies that this is impossible, since the algorithm is deliberately blinded to the race of the applicants. Indeed, that was part of the bank's rationale for implementing the system. Even so, statistics show that the bank's approval rate for black applicants has been steadily dropping. Submitting ten apparently equally qualified genuine applicants (as determined by a separate panel of human judges) shows that the algorithm accepts white applicants and rejects black applicants.

<section>
  <h2>Why does AI have ethical requirements?</h2>
  <div class="fragment">
    <p>AI has ethical requirements through <i>inheritance</i>.</p>
    <p>Machines take on cognitive work with social dimensions from humans.</p>
  </div>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>How would you specifcy ethical requirements for AI?</h2>
</section>
<!--
<section>
  <section>
    <h2>What are the ethical requirements for AIs?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Transparency to inspection</b>
      <li><b>Predictability</b>
      <li><b>Robustness against manipulation</b></li>
      <li><b>Responsibility</b></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>Explaining point 2: Predictability</h2>
    <p>Predictability is related to the principle of <i>stare decisis</i> in the legal system.</p>
    <p>The job of the legal system is not necessarily to optimize society, but to provide a predictable environment within which citizens can optimize their own lives.</p>

<section>
  <h2>3 Laws of Robotics</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
    <li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with Law 1.</li>
    <li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with Laws 1 &amp; 2.</li>
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Static laws</h2>
  <blockquote>
    What if Archimedes of Syracuse had been able to create a long‐lasting AI with a fixed version of the moral code of Ancient Greece?
  </blockquote>
</section>
<!--
<section>
  <h2>Different from engineering other artifacts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-intelligent artifacts have a purpose that is implicit in the contruction of the artifact.</li>
    <li>Example: Putting a cloth in a toaster leads to problems not anticipated by the toaster.</li>
    <li>However, thinking machines will have <i>generic</i> intelligence.</li>
    <li>Generic purposes cannot be anticipated locally, i.e., in the design.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
-->
<section>
  <h2>AI behavior is specified <i>non-locally</i></h2>
  <p class="fragment">Deep Blue was not programmed in terms of individual chess moves.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Watson was not programmed in terms of individual trivia questions.</p>
  <p class="fragment">AIs are programmed in terms of the optimization of a non-local criterion (winning chess, answering trivia questions).</p>
  <p class="fragment">Thus... Good behavior ought to be a non-local extrapolation of (future) consequences of generic behavior.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <section>
    <h2>Ethical requirements specification for AIs</h2>
    <!--<p>How do you build an AI which, when it executes, becomes more ethical than you?</p>-->
    <p>Require the AI to think like a human engineer concerned about ethics, not just a simple product of ethical engineering.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>An AI programmed by Archimedes, with no more moral expertise than Archimedes has, should be able to recognize our own civilization's ethics as moral progress when compared to Ancient Greece.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Future engineer</h2>
  <blockquote>
    "Well, I have no idea how this airplane I built will fly safely—indeed I have no idea how it will fly at all, whether it will flap its wings or inflate itself with helium or something else I haven’t even imagined—but I assure you, the design is very, very safe."

  <h1>Part III: Superintelligence</h1>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Superintelligence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Weak superintelligence</b>: [Quantitative] Increased processing speed.</li>
    <li><b>Strong superintelligence</b> [Quantitative]
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Analogies for superintelligence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Differences between humans</li>
    <li>Differences between past and present civilizations</li>
    <li>Differences between humans and other animals</li>
  </ul>

  Imagine running a dog mind at very high speed. Would a thousand years of doggy living add up to any human insight?

  <h2>Good-story bias</h2>
  <p>Intuitions about which future scenarios are plausible and realistic may be shaped by what is seen in media, overestimating the probability of scenarios that make for a good story.</p>
