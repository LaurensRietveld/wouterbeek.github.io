    You did everything right. You had a complicated schema, yet you were using OWL consistently. You had serialized the schema with no syntax error whatsoever. Your schema would be registered with a Purl URI and would be available over HTTP. Yet... while the data was syntactically correct, you would make a typo in the way in which each and every comment in the file starts (<code><--</code> i.o. <code><!--</code>), making it impossible for a machine processor to distinguish your pristine schema from the mundane comments interspersed.
